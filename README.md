# PathFinder
A simple, universal A* pathfinding controller for any type of 2D game for Unity3D.

PathFinder draws an area of a set size, and then breaks up the area into nodes.
Each node then does a box cast to check for a collision, and marks the node as unwalkable if a collision is detected.

Feel free to use for whatever. No credit required.
